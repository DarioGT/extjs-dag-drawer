extjs-dag-drawer
================
ExtJS component (extjs >= 4.1) for drawing trees (actually Directed Acyclic Graphs).

This component uised the **Draw** package to layout and draw *Direct Acyclic Graphs*, i.e. oriented graphs without cycles.
It can be used for instance to draw dependency graphs, rganizational charts ...

## Credits: Algorithm for drawing the graph

The implementation of the algorithms are heavily inspired by chapter nine of the book [Graph drawing:
algorithms for the visualization of graphs](http://books.google.com/books/about/Graph_drawing.html?id=Dt4eAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y).
